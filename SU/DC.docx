Sometimes I wish, DC++ did not exist.
Sometimes I wonder what campus was, before LAN came to rooms. how people used to go out and meet other people.
How staying in room all day was the most boring thing ever possible.
Computers and laptops changed everything.
DC++ changed everything.
Now, sitting in room and watching movies, TV series and Porn is the thing to do.
I despise this reclusive culture.
I would even go on to say that the negatives outweigh the positives in this case.
