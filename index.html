<h1>Welcome to the BITS Wiki Project!</h1>
<p>
This project has been started with the single aim in mind, "To document and archive everything about BITS that was, that is and that will be." Bringing all content about BITS together and open for all to access anytime. The author simply wishes for knowledge to be available to all.
<\p>
<p>
I always felt that we were losing the culture of BITS with every subsequent batch simply failing to inherit it from their seniors. For this, the seniors are equally to blame as they focus on themselves rather than passing it dutifully to the juniors. Many traditions have been lost to time. Pilani is simply not what it used to be. This project will try to bring everything out in open. No more doubts, no more ambiguities. Every opportunity available on campus will be detailed here. All material generated till date by BITS, as much I can find, I will try and bring it all together.

The project is currently under development (at full speed). All additions are welcome to this immense knowledge source about everything BITS. You are welcome to send your pull requests to this repository. You can read further guidelines for contribution on this page.
